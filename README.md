# CarDekho-Price-Prediction_ML-Project
This project analyzes a dataset of 15,411 used cars from the CarDekho platform to understand the factors affecting used car prices and build a predictive model for price estimation.  We use EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), feature engineering, and machine learning to identify key trends and insights.
